Hi.!
ignore the randomness of code it was completed in two days for my college submission

I'll tell you want you need to do to run it

testing data is getting stored in a folder name images in the same directory as the program

I have deleted my testing data so you will need to add yours or anyone else's

There is a default folder named 0 and is designated to keep testing data of only one person if you want to run the program for 2 people create an folder named 1 for the other person 

Note:Do not keep the folder empty an error will pop.

for eg. I have designed the folder named 0 for me, now if you want to stored your data make a new folder 1 and run scan.py it will prompt you for folder name and start taking images thru the front cam and store it in the folder you entered.
There should not be any folder created without pics in it.

after you have made the testing data edit submitable.py and change the names string according to your folder person's name

this program was only a part of my project so there is a part of code which sends data to arduino . This is the part i have commented out.

The name of the person,time and data of the recognized person is saved in data.txt file

For any more help you can revert back to me on the same email address.


add training images in /images/0/
